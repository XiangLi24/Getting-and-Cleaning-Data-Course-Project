# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

The repo is created for Cousera course Getting and Cleaning Data week4 course project.

The object of run_analysis.R is processing raw data into tidy data.

The raw data is from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

There are 5 steps in run_analysis.R.
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



'run_analysis.R': Contains all process code.
'seconddata.txt': Shows the result of Step5 in run_analysis.R
'Variables.txt': Describes the variables.
